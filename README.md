# GAW_Layout_Signals

With this sketch and 4 of my [MCP23017 boards](https://github.com/GerardWassink/GAW_I2C_32port_Expander), one can drive 64 model-railroad two-aspect signals.

More description follows.

Loconet will be added in the (near) future.

## Test-setup

See below for a test-setup with two boards (32 signals).
